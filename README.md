# FlightHub Insight

This is a project adapted from a CS 411 [Course project](https://github.com/cs411-alawini/fa23-cs411-team067-Sparkling) at UIUC.

Data: [2015 US Transporation from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/usdot/flight-delays.)

# Todo

- [x] add Redis as a cache
- [ ] Re-configure the front end using React
- [ ] Add ORM to prevent SQL injection
- [ ] Lump private info in .env file
- [ ] Since there are so many rows, try retrieve 20 rows at a time
